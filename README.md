Enhanced Hexy
=============
Extension of the well known robot Hexy of ArcBotics

#### What is it?
This is a re-write of the excellent software that came with Hexy. My goals are to let Hexy act like a pet with a (G)oal (O)riented (A)ction (P)lanning AI.

#### Main Ideas
* We want the Robot behaves like a pet
* The basis is the behavior of a Sims 3 Character
* To better interact with the environment we add more sensors

#### Hardware extensions
Our company hexy has been enhanced with the following hardware components:
* DFRobot Color Sensor TCS3200
* DFRobot URM V3.2 Ultrasonic Sensor
* DFRobot Sound Sensor
* DFRobot LM35 Linear Temperature Sensor
* Laser Module - Red with TTL Control
* Arduino Sensor Shield
* 3.2" TFT LCD Touch Shield for Arduino
* Additional Arduino Uno Rev3
* Rasperrry Pi for high level AI

#### Software extensions
##### High Level GOAP AI
##### Low Level Hexy Code
##### RC Android Application
